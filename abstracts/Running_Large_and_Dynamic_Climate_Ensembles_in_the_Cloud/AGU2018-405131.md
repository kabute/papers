## Abstract Text:
Climate and meteorological oriented software and simulations
usage in Cloud Systems is growing and has proven to be a feasible
and solid solution for these scientific applications.
In previous works, we exposed how Cloud systems can be the base
to run climate simulations for researchers that can not or do not
want to manage the needed computational resources.
Here we present our work, results, and findings, including insights
about performance and high availability, about running large
ensembles with WRF over BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing) on Cloud Computing environments.
